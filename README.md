Restaurant-Reservation
Restaurant reservation is a monorepo project that will help make, edit, delete and update reservations. The front end of the project is created using react and a router for different pages in order to make and search for reservations, make new tables, and search for reservations by name. The reservations can also be assigned to a table and can be marked as finished to allow another reservations to occupy said table. The backend is made using Node.JS and connects to a database in elephantSQL. There are several middleware functions to ensure that all posted data recieved from the front-end is within the scope of the restaurants hours, among other requirements. I believe that this project is a great final milestone from my time at Thinkful and displays the full-stack knowledge I've gained.

To install, run NPM Install in both the front and backend folders, and NPM start in both to run.
